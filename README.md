# My Portfolio

Desription:

This project was designed to showcase my coding projects, while giving me an opportunity to become more familiar with Bootsrap. It includes an 'About Me', 'My Portfolio' and 'Contact Me' page.

Though HTML and CSS are not new for me, toward the end of the project, I learned how to use the inspect tools to streamline changes in my CSS.

There are some place holders in 'My Portfolio' that will be filled in as I create more projects. The form on the 'Cantact Me' page does not function yet.
